My name is Tobias and I work as a Python DevOp.

I don't really program much outside of work, but here are some of my dumb hobby projects. They mostly revolve around chess and rudimentary parsing.

# Hobby projects

## Chess utilities

- [pgn](http://github.com/tobiasvl/pgn) – an improved fork of [capicue/pgn](http://github.com/capicue/pgn), a PGN file parser written in Ruby
- [pgnlint](http://github.com/tobiasvl/pgnlint) – a linter for PGN files (work in progress)
- Some tools for working with the ratings of the Norwegian Chess Federation (NSF) – these repos are private for the time being, but some of their results power [Sjakknytt](http://sjakknytt.no) (and indirectly [Sjakkrating](http://sjakkrating.no)).
  - [pgn-add-nsf](https://github.com/tobiasvl/pgn-add-nsf) is one of the dumb tools of that package. You probably won't find it useful.

## [reddit tools](http://github.com/tobiasvl/reddit-tools)

Some small but useful scripts for reddit. I also have a larger reddit project that might be revealed to the public in the future. 

## [studweb](http://github.com/tobiasvl/studweb)

Notifications when you receive new grades at the University of Oslo and select other learning institutions in Norway.

## [pyncho](http://github.com/tobiasvl/pyncho)

A small blogging application implemented in Python. It works with flat text files and generates HTML. You probably don't want to use it, because it uses a markup language I made up.

## [marxup](http://github.com/tobiasvl/marxup)

The markup language used in pyncho. Not very sofisticated.

# Future projects / works in progress

## The Long Point

A blogging application of sorts, inspired by projects like https://github.com/judofyr/timeless (the name is a tribute to Troy Scott, rest his soul, the creative genius of [Reldni](http://reldni.com))

## saibot

An XMPP bot. Or maybe a Slack bot, I hear that's the rage now. Or maybe just an IRC bot. All I know is that I want it to be named saibot.
