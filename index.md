My name is Tobias and I work as a Python DevOp.

Here are some of my dumb hobby projects. They mostly revolve around Game Boy, chess and rudimentary parsing.

# Hobby projects

## Game Boy

I'm slightly active in the Game Boy homebrew community, and have contributed a lot to the [Awesome Game Boy Development](https://github.com/avivace/awesome-gbdev) list. I also have some private projects:

- [language-rgbasm](https://atom.io/packages/language-rgbasm) - RGBASM (RGBDS assembly) language support in Atom
- A puzzle game for the Nintendo Game Boy, written in assembly with [RGBDS](https://github.com/rednex/rgbds). Will be made public when it's feature ready (due to code vanity).

## Chess utilities

- Some tools for working with the ratings of the Norwegian Chess Federation (NSF) which power [Sjakknytt](http://sjakknytt.no) (and indirectly [Sjakkrating](http://sjakkrating.no)). Pretty specific tools.
  - [decrypt-nsf-elo](https://github.com/tobiasvl/decrypt-nsf-elo) - small script to decrypt unofficial NSF Elo rating
  - [flask-decrypt-nsf-elo](https://github.com/tobiasvl/flask-decrypt-nsf-elo) - dumb Flask app which acts as an "integration" for the above
  - [pgn-add-nsf](https://github.com/tobiasvl/pgn-add-nsf) - add NSF Elo rating to PGN database using name heuristics
- [pgn](http://github.com/tobiasvl/pgn) – now merged upstream, was an improved fork of [capicue/pgn](http://github.com/capicue/pgn), a PGN file parser written in Ruby
- [pgnlint](http://github.com/tobiasvl/pgnlint) – a linter for PGN files (work in progress)

## Other stuff

- [reddit tools](http://github.com/tobiasvl/reddit-tools) - Some small but perhaps useful scripts for reddit/PRAW. I also have a larger reddit project that might be revealed to the public in the future. 
- [studweb](http://github.com/tobiasvl/studweb) - Notifications when you receive new grades at the University of Oslo and select other learning institutions in Norway. It was pretty popular, but doesn't work anymore.
- [pyncho](http://github.com/tobiasvl/pyncho) - A small blogging application implemented in Python. It works with flat text files and generates HTML. You probably don't want to use it, because it uses a markup language I made up.
- [marxup](http://github.com/tobiasvl/marxup) - The markup language used in pyncho. Not very sofisticated.

## Future projects / works in progress

### cyby / The Search for the New Sun

A website to perform full-text search in ebooks (think [A Search of Ice and Fire](http://asearchoficeandfire.com)).

### The Long Point

A blogging application of sorts, inspired by projects like https://github.com/judofyr/timeless (the name is a tribute to Troy Scott, rest his soul, the creative genius of [Reldni](http://reldni.com))
