They mostly revolve around chess and rudimentary parsing.\r\n\r\n# Hobby projects\r\n\r\n## Chess utilities\r\n\r\n- [pgn](http://github.com/tobiasvl/pgn) – an improved fork of [capicue/pgn](http://github.com/capicue/pgn), a PGN file parser written in Ruby\r\n- [pgnlint](http://github.com/tobiasvl/pgnlint) – a linter for PGN files (work in progress)\r\n- Some tools for working with the ratings of the Norwegian Chess Federation (NSF) – these repos are private for the time being, but some of their results power [Sjakknytt](http://sjakknytt.no) (and indirectly [Sjakkrating](http://sjakkrating.no)).\r\n  - [pgn-add-nsf](https://github.com/tobiasvl/pgn-add-nsf) is one of the dumb tools of that package. You probably won't find it useful.\r\n\r\n## [reddit tools](http://github.com/tobiasvl/reddit-tools)\r\n\r\nSome small but useful scripts for reddit. I also have a larger reddit project that might be revealed to the public in the future. \r\n\r\n## [studweb](http://github.com/tobiasvl/studweb)\r\n\r\nNotifications when you receive new grades at the University of Oslo and select other learning institutions in Norway.\r\n\r\n## [pyncho](http://github.com/tobiasvl/pyncho)\r\n\r\nA small blogging application implemented in Python. It works with flat text files and generates HTML. You probably don't want to use it, because it uses a markup language I made up.\r\n\r\n## [marxup](http://github.com/tobiasvl/marxup)\r\n\r\nThe markup language used in pyncho. Not very sofisticated.\r\n\r\n# Future projects / works in progress\r\n\r\n## The Long Point\r\n\r\nA blogging application of sorts, inspired by projects like https://github.com/judofyr/timeless (the name is a tribute to Troy Scott, rest his soul, the creative genius of [Reldni](http://reldni.com))\r\n\r\n## saibot\r\n\r\nAn XMPP bot. Or maybe a Slack bot, I hear that's the rage now. Or maybe just an IRC bot. All I know is that I want it to be named saibot.",
